FlashMath
=========

the repository for the k-12 program designed to help kids with math

Please use the standard workflow of:
  1.) Fork your own local branch
  2.) Push to your own remote branch when ready to commit
  3.) Make a pull request to master and Zach will merge your code 
  after looking at it
  
There are some things that should really be done:

  1.) Add special division cases to the numbers generated
  2.) Add special cases for subtraction and division so the second number is smaller
  than the first for easier difficulties.
