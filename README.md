FlashMath
=========


the repository for the k-12 program designed to help kids with math

How to run:
  
  1.) You can run this on any server as long as it serves the index.html file.
  
  2.) If you dont know how to set up a server, xampp is a very easy server and required no effort to start.
    
    a.) Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html and follow the installation instructions.
    
    b.) Copy the entire repo into the htdocs folder in your xampp installation.
    
    c.) Start the xampp control panel and start the apache server service.


Please use the standard workflow of:


  1.) Fork your own local branch.
  
  2.) Push to your own remote branch when ready to commit.
  
  3.) Make a pull request to master and Zach will merge your code after looking at it.
  
  
There are some things that should really be done:


  1.) Add special division cases to the numbers generated.
  
  2.) Add special cases for subtraction and division so the second number is smaller than the first for easier difficulties.
